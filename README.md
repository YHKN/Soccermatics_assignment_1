# Soccermatics_assignment_1

This my result of the first assignment of the open version of David Sumpter's course **Soccermatics - Mathematical Modelling in Football** of fall 2022.

The task was to make an assumption of a part of a player's performance, either at the men's EUROS 2021 or the women's EUROS 2022, and then write a one page report proving or disproving your assumption based on the data. The data to be used in this assignment was the free **statsbomb** data for those competitions.

For this assignment I chose hungarian striker **Roland Sallai** and tried to assess his ability to keep possession fo the ball and complete passes when being pressured.

The notebook contains the code I used to create my report and some additional ideas that didn't make it in.
